# Simple-Bass-Boosting-Program
Implementing a simple bass booster in Python using LP and HP Butterworth filters. 
Bass booster also implemented with a shelving filter, with convolution and with prebuilt Python functions. 

The sample .wav file used in the notebook is uploaded along with the notebook. Unfortunately since .wav files are uncompressed, the notebook was too large for github. Thus one would have to download the notebook and the .wav file in the repository to see the results generated by the Python script. 

Feel free to modify any of the boosting methods here and use them in whatever you wish such as turning any of them into a plug in or app.
