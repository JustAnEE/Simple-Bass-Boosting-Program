# Simple-Bass-Boosting-Program
Implementing a simple bass booster in Python using LP and HP Butterworth filters. 
Bass booster also implemented with a shelving filter, with convolution and with prebuilt Python functions. 

The sample .wav file used in the notebook is uploaded along with the notebook. Unfortunately since .wav files are uncompressed, the notebook was too large for github and many of the generated graphs in the notebook are not generated in the github display. 

The file shelvingfilter.py contains the fastest way shown in the notebook to bass boost the audio. 

Feel free to use and edit any of the files in this repository.
