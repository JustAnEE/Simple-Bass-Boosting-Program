# Simple-Bass-Boosting-Program
Implementing a simple bass booster in Python using LP and HP Butterworth filters. 
Bass booster also implemented with a shelving filter, with convolution and with prebuilt Python functions. 

The sample .wav file used in the notebook is uploaded along with the notebook. Unfortunately since .wav files are uncompressed, the notebook was too large for github and many of the generated graphs in the notebook are not generated in the github display. 

Feel free to modify any of the boosting methods here and use them in whatever way you wish such as turning any of them into a plugin or app.
